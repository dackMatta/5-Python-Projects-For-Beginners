# Hands on Git hub commands assignment

This project is based on a YouTube video downloader with tutorials from [TechWithTim](https://www.youtube.com/TechWithTim). 
First,  i cloned the project repository to my local machine using `git clone`,
then navigate into the project directory with `cd \5-Python-Projects-For-Beginners-1> `.
I then Fork the project to my GitHub account by clicking "Fork" on the original repository page.
I created and switch to a new branch (`git checkout -b utube-video-downloader`) where you i add a new Python project file named `video_downloader.py` 
`git add video_downloader.py`
`git commit -m "Add video_downloader.py for YouTube video downloader"`
I Merged the  changes into the `main` branch (`git checkout main`, `git merge utube-video-downloader`) and handle potential merge conflicts with `git status` and resolving conflicts manually in affected files.
 Lastly, I've created a basic portfolio page under `index.html` and used github pages to deploy it which you can visit [here](https://dackmatta.github.io/5-Python-Projects-For-Beginners/).

The assignment succinctly covered the open source project setup, branching, file addition, merging, conflict handling, and provides a link to the portfolio page hosted on GitHub Pages.
