# GitHub Commands Assignment: YouTube Video Downloader

This project is a YouTube video downloader guided by tutorials from [TechWithTim](https://www.youtube.com/TechWithTim).

## Getting Started

1. I Cloned the project repository to my local machine:
   ```
   git clone 
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```
   cd 5-Python-Projects-For-Beginners-1
   ```

## Forking and Branching

1. I forked the project to my GitHub account by clicking "Fork" on the original repository page.
2. Create and switch to a new branch for the YouTube video downloader:
   ```
   git checkout -b utube-video-downloader
   ```

## Adding New Features

1. Add a new Python project file named `video_downloader.py`:
   ```
   git add video_downloader.py
   git commit -m "Add video_downloader.py for YouTube video downloader"
   ```

## Merging Changes

1. Merge the changes into the `main` branch and handle potential merge conflicts:
   ```
   git checkout main
   git merge utube-video-downloader
   git status
   ```
2. Resolve conflicts manually in affected files if necessary.

## Deployment

- Created a basic portfolio page under `index.html`.
- Deployed using GitHub Pages, which you can visit [here](https://dackmatta.github.io/5-Python-Projects-For-Beginners/).
